## Purpose

EthOS provides a minimal, stable, and modular OS that allows users to:

- **Run smart home backend locally** for device discovery, onboarding, and control.
- **Integrate multiple hardware protocols** like Zigbee, Z-Wave, Matter, Thread, and MQTT.
- **Ensure privacy and security** by keeping all smart home data local.
- **Provide persistent storage** for device configurations and automations.
